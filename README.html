<p>A 2D platformer featuring Blackbeard as he fights his way back to civilization.</p>

<p>=======================</p>

<p>My goals: </p>

<ol>
<li>Implement Menu data structure</li>
<li>Implement save file structure and saving functionality</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<h1 id="gamestory">Game Story</h1>

<p>You&#8217;re a pirate captain who was overthrown by his crew and thrown overboard with nothing but your clothes and your (overly intelligent) talking parrot. You wake up washed up on a remote island in the middle of the ocean, but LUCKILY, on the island is the entrance to a tunnel that goes under the ocean and (hopefully) leads back to civilization. Platforming adventure ensues.</p>

<p>Pirate Ship Name: Red Death of the South</p>

<p>Your parrot will act predominantly as a tutorial navi/puzzle gimmick/straight man to comically counter the player character&#8217;s pirate stupidity.</p>

<p>The game will be a straightforward level-based action-platformer.</p>
