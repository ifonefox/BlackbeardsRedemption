# Game Story

You're a pirate captain who was overthrown by his crew and thrown overboard with nothing but your clothes and your (overly intelligent) talking parrot. You wake up washed up on a remote island in the middle of the ocean, but LUCKILY, on the island is the entrance to a tunnel that goes under the ocean and (hopefully) leads back to civilization. Platforming adventure ensues.

Pirate Ship Name: Red Death of the South

Your parrot will act predominantly as a tutorial navi/puzzle gimmick/straight man to comically counter the player character's pirate stupidity.

The game will be a straightforward level-based action-platformer.
